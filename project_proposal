	Athletic.net is a website that stores times for competing high school and collegiate athletes in cross
country and track and field. My proposed project is to use a bash script to scrape the website for data on each 
athlete in the events that they competed and store it as they progress over time.  With the data collected, I 
would like to be able to use a program to input a persons age, events, and times and compare them with other 
athletes with the same parameters.
	A testing plan that I would use would be to work with subsections of the website, such as specific 
states, schools, or even individuals to make sure that the script gathers and outputs the data in an appropriate 
format. I can then build up to larger and larger sections of the website, dealing with how the information is 
stored differently in the html of each page. Separate code can be used for analysis and displaying the relevant 
information. This would be included with a makefile.
	In the future, I would like to use this script and code with machine learning to be able to predict how 
an athlete might progress over their career. I do not think that it will be feasible within the constraints of 
this course; however, it is an interesting idea that Ive had for a while now. Many people within the running 
community have attempted to be able to predict times within their events, but they have not been able to find 
a method that accurately predicts times. If this idea is successful, it might be able solve an issue that has 
been around since the beginning of the sport.
